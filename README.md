Project Name: EyeDentified
Developers: Elaine Ge, Sylvia Niu, Jiabei Li
Great Thanks to Cohere AI for giving free API to help us with the completion of the project

General Description:

Hi! This is the project we(Elaine Ge, Sylvia Niu, Jiabei Li) have done during these two days. 

The project name is called "EyeDentified", which is dedicated to help blind people who needs identification of something but has no one helping them.

Instruction of using "EyeDentified"

"F" : Open the camera
"J" : Close the camera
" " (space) : Take the picture
Enter: Save the photos

When the photos have taken, Cohere AI would provide a general description about the picture, then the description would be read out loud. This would potentially helping blind people with the ability to recognize the object.

Regarding the key choice, we have chosen the keys that would be recognized easier. F and J are two keys with some concave on the keys, helping blind people recognizing them easily. Space and Enter are also two keys with easy identification.

Some Interesting design:
The background would "close" the eyes if the camera is closed currently.

The name "EyeDentified" is same pronunciation as "Identified", which aligns with our goal: Helping people with "eye" issues "identify" the object for them.


Thank you for taking look at the project. As a student, we really want to contribute to the society, helping those who has accessibility issues with our ability in technology. We do hope that in the future, we will be able to help people with technology. This is our first step.
